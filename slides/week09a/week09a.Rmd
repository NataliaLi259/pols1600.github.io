# Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)

.font150[
* As we have discussed before, sometimes it is unfeasible to conduct an experiment to evaluate a question of interest. E.g.:

  - Education and income
  - Incumbency and reelection rates
  - Gun laws and homicides
  - Drunk driving and accidents
  
* Observations tend to have _systematic differences_

* .orange[However:] some candidates might be suitable for comparison

# Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)

.font150[
* RDD's basic setup: treatment is assigned according to a **precise rule** based on another variable

  - Test scores, voting percentage, legislation timing, drinking age

* Useful for analysis in a "rule-based" world (administrative programs, elections, etc.)

* People who barely passed and who barely failed are comparable in many dimensions

* RDDs are a _quasi-experimental_ method at the cutoff (_and only at the cutoff_!)

.font150[
**Note:** we only measure _local average treatment effect_ (LATE)
]
---

# RDD Assumptions

.font150[
* Assignment "as good as random": the forcing variable is the _only_ source variation

  - If graphs show _no other discontinuities_, the design is more credible
  
* Individuals _cannot choose_ if they are in the treatment or control group (_no sorting_)

* If treatment is not deterministic (fuzzy RDD), statistical adjustements are necessary

# Effect of Scholarship 

.font150[
* [Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960)](https://obsstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/regression_discontinuity_all_comments-1.pdf) study the effects of collegescholarships on later studentsâ€™ achievements

* Observation: scholarship winners have different attitudes

* Are scholarship winners more likely to pursue further education or become teachers?

* Spoiler: yes!
