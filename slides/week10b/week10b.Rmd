# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Brief review:
  - Axioms
  - Permutations
  - Combinations
  - Conditional probabilities
  
* Bayes' theorem
]
---

# Review: Axioms

.font150[
* The probability of an event is a real number greater than or equal to 0
 
* The probability that at least one of all the possible outcomes of a process (such as rolling a die) will occur is 1 

* If two events A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of either A or B occurring is the probability of A occurring plus the probability of B occurring 
]

# Review: Permutation

.font140[
* Permutation is just a fancy name for _the number of ways we can arrange things_

* Example: in how many ways we can arrange 3 people?
]
--
.font140[
* We can count:
* ABC / ACB / BAC / BCA / CAB / CBA
]
--
.font140[
* Or we can think like this: 
  - How many people can we pick for the first seat? 3
  - How many people we can pick for the second seat? 2
  - And for the last one? 1
  
* Therefore, we have $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3! = 6$ 
]
---

# Review: Permutation

.font150[
* What if we have 5 people? In how many ways can they be arranged?
]
--
.font150[
* _Five factorial_: 120
]
--
.font150[
* 5 people can sit in chair 1, 4 in chair 2, 3 in chair 3, 2 in chair 2, 1 in chair 1

* That's where we get 120 from!
]
---

# Review: Permutation

.font150[
* What if we still have the same 5 people but we don't have 5 chairs?
]
--
.font150[
* Let's say we have 5 people and only 3 chairs. How many ways can 5 people sit in 3 chairs?
]
.font150[
* 5 in the first chair, 4 in the second, 3 in the third _and that's all_: $5 \times 4 \times 3$
 $$\frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1} = \frac{5!}{2!}$$
 
* Formula = $\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$, where $n$ is the number of people and $k$ is the number of places/seats 
]

# Review: Permutation

.font150[
* The formula is useful, _but personally I never use it_

* Tip: _think about the question first_, then you don't need to memorise anything

*
