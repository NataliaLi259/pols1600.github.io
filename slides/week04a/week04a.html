.font150[
* Randomisation creates balance, have higher interal validity but lower external validity

* Observational studies are prone to selection bias, have confounding variables, lower internal validity, higher external validity

* In this exercise, we analyse the data from two experiments in which households were canvassed for support on gay marriage.

* This exercise is based on: LaCour, M. J., and D. P. Green. 2014. “[When Contact Changes Minds: An Experiment on Transmission of Support for Gay Equality.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1256151)” *Science* 346(6215): 1366–69.

* Canvassers were given a script leading to conversations that averaged about twenty minutes. A distinctive feature of this study is that gay and straight canvassers were randomly assigned to households and canvassers revealed whether they were straight or gay in the course of the conversation. The experiment aims to test the 'contact hypothesis,' which contends that out-group hostility (towards gays in this case) diminishes when people from different groups interact with one another.

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

* Each observation of this data set is a respondent giving a response to a five-point survey item on same-sex marriage.  There are two different studies in this data set, involving interviews during 7 different time periods (i.e. 7 waves).  In both studies, the first wave consists of the interview before the canvassing treatment occurs. 

* Use the [gay.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pols1600/pols1600.github.io/master/datasets/causality/gay.csv) data set.

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* **Question 1**

* Using the baseline interview wave before the treatment is administered (wave == 1), examine whether randomization was properly conducted. Base your analysis on the three groups of Study 1: 
  - 'Same-Sex Marriage Script by Gay Canvasser'
  - 'Same-Sex Marriage Script by Straight Canvasser'
  - 'No Contact.'
  
* Briefly comment on the results.

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* The results show that before treatment, all three treatment groups show similar levels of baseline support for gay marriage on average. Thus, the randomization appears to have been done correctly.

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* **Question 2**

* The second wave of survey was implemented two months after the canvassing.  Using Study 1, estimate the average treatment effects of gay and straight canvassers on support for same-sex marriage, separately (wave == 2).  Give a brief interpretation of the results.
