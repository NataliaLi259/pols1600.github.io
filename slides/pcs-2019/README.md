# xaringan-metropolis

This is a slightly modified version of the [metropolis theme](https://github.com/pat-s/xaringan-metropolis) for [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). I have added only minor tweaks to the original theme, such as a preconfigured option to insert orange text, a progress bar (which is also orange), larger MathJax fonts, and small changes in the formatting.

The there is available for download at <https://github.com/danilofreire/xaringan-metropolis>. You can see how it looks like [here](https://danilofreire.github.io/xaringan-metropolis/xaringan-metropolis.html). 

Tip: if you use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/), add the extension [Fullscreen Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen_plus/) and press `Ctrl+Shift+F` to see your slides in fullscreen mode. 

Thanks to [Patrick Schratz](https://pjs-web.de/) and [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/) for their great work!
