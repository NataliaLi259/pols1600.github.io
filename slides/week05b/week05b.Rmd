# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Brief recap

* Social desirability bias

* List experiments 

* Final project
]

---

# Descriptive Statistics

.font150[
* Quantiles, quartiles, median, IQR, SD

* Standard deviation: average distance from points to the mean
	
	- $SD = (\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum^{N}_{i = 1} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}})$  

* Outliers: 1.5x IQR

* Median is robust to outliers

* When $n$ is large, mean and median are roughly the same
]

---

# Bar Plots

.font150[
* Bar plots, histograms, box plots 

* Bar plots:

	- Describe factor variables
	- `barplot(prop.table(table(dataset$variable)))`
]

---

# Bar Plots

```{r}
afghan <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pols1600/pols1600.github.io/master/datasets/measurement/afghan.csv")
barplot(prop.table(table(afghan$violent.exp.taliban)), main = "Taliban Victimisation Rate")
```

---

# Histograms

.font150[
* Histograms

	- Describe numeric variables
	- Shows the shape of the variable distribution
	- Densities are .orange[not] percentiles
	- Densities are the proportion of _each bin_
	- `hist(dataset$variable, freq = FALSE)`
]

---

# Histograms

```{r}
hist(afghan$age, main = "Age Distribution")
```


---

# Box Plots

.font150[
* Box plots

	- Distribution of a numeric variable
	- Quartiles, median, IQR, outliers
	- `boxplot(variable ~ group)` (where `~ group` is optional)
]
---

# Box Plots

```{r}
boxplot(afghan$age ~ afghan$province, main = "Age Distribution by province")
```


---

# Survey Biases

.font150[
* Last week we discussed two types of biases:

	- Individual non-response
	- Item non-response
]

---

# Survey Biases

.font150[
* Quota sampling versus random sampling

* Quote sampling doesn't control for .orange[unobservables]

* Random sampling produces groups identical on average

* Difficulties:

	- Some individuals have more chances of being selected
	- Costs
]

---

# Social Desirability Bias

.font150[
* Respondents sometimes do not state their true preferences

* Examples: support for drug use, abortion, etc

* Underestimation of true proportion
]

---

# List Experiments

.font150[
* .orange[List experiments] can minimise the problem

* Grant anonymity to respondents

* Control group sees a list of statements

* Treatment group sees the same list _plus a sensitive item_

* _Assuming that respondents don't lie and that both groups would answer the same number of non-sensitive items_, we can infer their true preferences
]
---

# Racial Attitudes

.font150[
* Example based on Graeme Blair and Kosuke Imai, 2012, [Statistical Analysis of List Experiments](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41403738), _Political Analysis_ 20(1), 47-77. 
]

# Racial Attitudes

.font150[
* Control group: 

Now  I’m  going  to  read  you  three  things  that  sometimes  make  people  angryor upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. (I don’t want to know which ones, just how many.)

1) “the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline;”

2) “professional athletes getting million-dollar-plus salaries;”

3) “large corporations polluting the environment.”

How many, if any, of these things upset you?
]

# List experiments

.font130[
* Treatment group: 

Now  I’m  going  to  read  you  three  things  that  sometimes  make  people  angryor upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. (I don’t want to know which ones, just how many.)

1) “the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline;”

2) “professional athletes getting million-dollar-plus salaries;”

3) “large corporations polluting the environment.”

.orange[4) “a black family moving next door to you.”]

How many, if any, of these things upset you?

# Racial Attitudes

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(list)
data(race)
summary(race)
```

---

# Racial Attitudes

```{r tidy=FALSE}
round(mean(race$y[race$treat == 1]) - mean(race$y[race$treat == 0]), 4)
diff.in.means <- ictreg(y ~ 1, data = race, treat = "treat",
                        J = 3, method = "lm")
summary(diff.in.means)
```
