# Law of Large Numbers

.font130[
* In many probabilistic models, certain patterns emerge as the sample size increases

* .orange[Law of Large Numbers:] If we have a sample of i.i.d. observations from random variable $X$ with expectation $\mathbb{E}(X)$, then

$$\bar{X}_{{n}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_{i} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}(X)$$]

* .orange[i.i.d.:] independent and identically distributed random variable. 

* In English: As the number of draws increases, the sample mean $\bar{X}_{{n}}$ approaches $\rightarrow$ the variable's distribution expectation $\mathbb{E}(X)$
]

# Law of Large Numbers

.font150[
* Examples

	- Rolling a die, 1000 times
	- Flipping a coin
	- Drawing respondents from a population of supporters and non-supporters for politician A
	- Statistical simulations

# Gambler's Fallacy

.font150[
* The Law of Large Numbers, as the name implies, is only valid for .orange[large samples]

* There is _no principle_ that supports the idea that after a few positive draws a negative draw must appear to "balance" the results

* Example: after 10 heads, _another head can come up_. Why?

# Infinite Monkey Theorem

# The Total Library

.font130[
"Everything would be in the Library's blind volumes. Everything: the detailed history of the future, Aeschylus' _The Egyptians_, the exact number of times that the waters of the Ganges have reflected the flight of a falcon, the secret and true nature of Rome, the encyclopedia Novalis would have constructed, my dreams and half-dreams at dawn on August 14, 1934, the proof of Pierre Fermat's theorem, [...] the song the sirens sang, the complete catalog of the Library, the proof of the inaccuracy of that catalog. Everything: but for every sensible line or accurate fact there would be millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings. Everything: but all the generations of mankind could pass before the dizzying shelves—shelves that obliterate the day and on which chaos lies—ever reward them with a tolerable page."

# Central Limit Theory

.font140[
* In practice we observe only the sample mean and _do not know the expectation_

* .orange[The central limit theorem] shows that the distribution of the sample mean approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases

* Again, not the sample itself approaches the normal distribution, .orange[but only the sample means]

* Z-score of the sample mean converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution or $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ as the sample size increases

* Interestingly the result is true .orange[for almost any distribution!]
]

# Central Limit Theory

.font150[
* Experiment: flip a coin 10 times and record the number of heads

* Repeat experiment above 1000 times

# Central Limit Theorem

.font110[
```{r clt01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,fig.height=5}
avgs <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000){
  samp <- rbinom(1000, 10, p=0.5)
  avgs[i] <- mean(samp)

plot(density(avgs))
```

# Centra Limit Theorem

.font150[
* Visualisation: <https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html>
]
---

# Central Limit Theorem

.font150[
* _Why do we care about it?_

* Hypothetically repeated polls with sample size $N$

* As the number of polls increase, we get closer and closer to the true population mean, _regardless of the distribution of the each particular poll_

* Since we are taking the means of each poll, rare events become even more rare

* It is really hard to get a "weird average" versus to get a "weird individual." That difficulty in getting a weird average is what pulls the plot into a nice tight bell curve
