* You've made it to the end of this course

* We've seen many things since the start of the semester

* What you've learned:
    - Two computer languages: R and Markdown
    - Plot graphs, calculate correlations, check descriptive statistics 
    - Calculate permutations, combinations and understand probability
    - Test hypotheses, run statistical models, read scientific literature

# More Statistics

.font130[
* [ECON 1629: Applied Research Methods for Economists](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1016763/assignments/syllabus)
    - Covers OLS, fixed effects, diff-in-diff, regression discontinuity, experiments (undergraduate)
    
* [ECON 1660: Big Data](https://dan.bjorkegren.com/bigdata/)
    - Introduction to machine learning with Python (undergraduate)
    
* [POLS 2000 - Strategies of Inquiry and Research Design](https://coursetools.brown.edu/syllabus/POLS:2000:2019-Spring:S01)
    - Teaches not only stats (focus on natural and lab experiments), but research design in general
    - Your current maths and R skills are _more than sufficient_ to follow this course
    - Ask for permission to attend: graduate students only

# More Statistics

.font150[
* [Coursera: Data Science Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
    - R, Git, build basic machine learning algorithms (10 modules)
    
* [Coursera: Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
    - More advanced (requires introductory linear algebra and calculus)
    - Build your own neural networks and other artificial intelligence algorithms (5 courses)
