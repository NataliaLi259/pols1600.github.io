# In Class Exercise

.font150[
* Four quick questions: 
    - Objective and subjective probability
	- Permutations
	- Combinations
	- Conditional probability
	
* And an interesting example of signalling
]
---

# Question 1: Frequentist x Bayesian Prob.

.font130[
* Identify the following as _frequentist_ (objective) and _Bayesian_ (subjective) probability claims:

    - Using her old gradebooks, Professor Lindström determines that the likelihood that one of her students earns an A is 0.18.
    - Professor Turan suspects that today few of his students have arrived to class well prepared.
    - Professor Long learns that over the past five years, 79% of his students have given him “Very Good” or “Excellent” ratings.
    - Professor Lee tells her students that nuclear war between Pakistan and India is unlikely.

# Question 1: Frequentist x Bayesian Prob.

.font150[
* .orange[Frequentist/objective probability:] the ratio between the number of times the event occurs and the number of trials, in repeated trials under the same conditions

* .orange[Bayesian/subjective probability:] measure of one's subjective belief about the likelihood of an event occurring

# Answers to Question 1

.font150[
1) Using her old gradebooks, Professor Lindström determines that the likelihood that one of her students earns an A is 0.18.]
--
.font150[
A: .orange[Frequentist.] the professor counts similar events (grades) in repeated trials (courses)
]
--
.font150[
2) Professor Turan suspects that today few of his students have arrived to class well prepared.]
--
.font150[
A: .orange[Bayesian.] Turan assumes this is the case based on one single observation (students' performance today) and his prior beliefs about the students' level of effort

3) Professor Long learns that over the past five years, 79% of his students have given him “Very Good” or “Excellent” ratings.]

.font150[
A: .orange[Frequentist.] Ratio of comparable events over time
]
--
.font150[
4) Professor Lee tells her students that nuclear war between Pakistan and India is unlikely.]
--
.font150[
A: .orange[Bayesian.] Unique event that cannot be repeated under the same conditions
]

# Question 2: Permutations

.font150[
*  Compute each of the following permutations (ordering matters):

1) How many ways there are to put 12 people in 5 chairs?

2) And 10 people in 10 chairs?

3) A zip code contains 5 digits. How many different zip codes can be made with the digits 0–9 if no digit is used more than once and the first digit is not 0?

# Answer2 to Question 2

.font150[
1) How many ways there are to put 12 people in 5 chairs?
]
--
.font150[
A: `\(\frac{12!}{(12-5)!} = 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 = 95,040\)`
]

.font150[
2) And 10 people in 10 chairs?
]
--
.font150[

```r
factorial(10) # New R command!

# Answers to Question 2

.font140[
* A zip code contains 5 digits. How many different zip codes can be made with the digits 0–9 if no digit is used more than once and the first digit is not 0? 
]
--
.font140[
A: For the first position, there are 9 possible choices (since 0 is not allowed). After that number is chosen, there are 9 possible choices (since 0 is now allowed). Then, there are 8 possible choices, 7 possible choices and 6 possible choices.

`$$9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 27,216$$`

.orange[Think about the problem first, then apply the formula!]

# Question 3: Combinations

.font150[
* To win a particular lottery game, a player chooses 4 numbers from 1 to 60. Each number can only be chosen once. If all numbers match the 4 winning numbers, regardless of order, the player wins. What is the probability that the winning numbers are 35, 2, 28, and 59?

* .orange[Do not use R to answer this question.]

* .orange[5-10 minutes to write the answer, 5-10 minutes for discussion]
]
---

# Answer to Question 3

.font140[
* We choose 4 numbers from 60. As _we don't care about the order_, we're talking about combinations
]
--
.font140[
* Formula: `\(\frac{n!}{(n-k)! k!}\)`
]
--
.font140[
* `\(\frac{60!}{(60-4)!4!} = \frac{60 \times 59 \times 58 \times 57 \times 56 ... \times 2 \times 1}{56! \times 4! }\)`
]
--
.font140[
* We cancel out everything from `\(56 \times 55 .... \times 1\)` in the nominator and `\(56!\)` in the denominator
]
--
.font140[
* We're left with `\(\frac{60 \times 59 \times 58 \times 57}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 487,635\)` 

* So the chance of having 35, 2, 28, and 59 as the winning numbers are `\(\frac{1}{487635}\)`
]

# Question 4: Conditional Probabilities

.font140[
* Researchers asked graduate students in Rhode Island about what they thought was the coolest idea in economics: signalling, supply and demand, or opportunity costs. Students of political science, sociology and economics were surveyed. Here are the results:

|                   | Political Science | Sociology | Economics | All |
| :---------------- | :---------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-- |
| Signalling        | 57                | 87        | 103       | 247 |
| Supply and demand | 50                | 42        | 49        | 141 |
| Opportunity costs | 42                | 22        | 26        | 90  |
| All               | 149               | 151       | 178       | 478 |

| **All**           | 149               | 151       | 178       | 478 |

* What is the probability that someone is a political scientist given that he thinks supply and demand is the coolest idea in economics?

* What is the probabily that someone likes signalling theory given that she studies economics?

# Answer 4 - Signalling

.font150[
* Answer: _most economists think signalling is the coolest idea in their field_

* ... and indeed it is!

* Congratulations if you've answered all questions correctly!

* .orange[But before you leave...]

* Professor Skarbek knows a lot about signalling and he has great stories to tell. Take a look at the picture on the next slide and think what is the signal being sent and to whom.
