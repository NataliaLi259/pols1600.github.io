# Final Project

.font130[
* Deadline: .orange[29th of April]

* 3,000-4,000 words (excluding `R` code and graphs)

* PDF format. You can write the main text in Word, LaTeX or RMarkdown, whichever you find easier to use

* You must provide an RMarkdown appendix file with complete R code and graphs

* RStudio add-in to count words: <https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin>

* 10-minute presentation

* 50% of your final grade
]
---

# Format

.font150[
* Introduction (1-1.5 pages)
    - What the paper is about
    - Why the topic is important today
    - What are the main results and conclusions

* Data (1 page)
    - Where did you get the data
    - In what format the data were available
    - How you imported the dataset into R
]

---

# Format

.font130[
* Descriptive Statistics (2-3 pages)
    - Show graphs and correlations _for main variables only_ 
    - Again: _just the most important variables_
    - What do the descriptive statistics indicate regarding the main question of the paper?
    
* Replication (3-4 pages)
    - Describe the paper's main results
    - Stay as closely as possible to the original findings
    - Report the coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels
]
---

# Format
    
.font150[
* Extension (2 pages)
    - Add a new analysis to the paper. Maybe delete some control variables, transform them, add new ones?
    - Do the main results hold or change?
    
* Discussion and Conclusion (1-1.5 page)
    - How could the authors improve the paper?
    - Any future research you would recommend?

.font130[
* Article: <https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701764>
* Replicate table 1
* Interaction models: `lm(dependent ~ ind01 + ind02 + I(ind1*ind2), data = dataset)`
]

# Tips

.font150[
* Don't worry if your coefficients are not exactly the same as the authors'

* Check if your findings are similar and if they remain positive or negative

* Also don't worry about clustered standard errors, fixed effects, or any other terms you don't know

* Most datasets are available on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) or on the article's website. You have access to all of them through Brown

* Let me know if you cannot find your article after 2 days

# Tips

.font150[
* Some models were estimated with Stata, another statistical software. Stata commands _won't work_ in R, but you should be able to translate them into R code

* To create tables in Markdown, use:
    - <https://help.github.com/en/articles/organizing-information-with-tables> 
    - Or <https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables>

* _Replications take time_: start early and share the work with your colleagues
]

# Presentations

.font150[
* Send me a pdf of your slides along with your assignment on the .orange[29th of April]

* Late submissions will be penalised

* If you use Powerpoint, please bring your computer to class

* Presentations should be short and straight to the point: .orange[10 minutes per group]

* No more than .orange[10 slides]: focus on the issues you encountered and on your main results

* Let me know if you need any help!
